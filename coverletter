Dear Editor-in-Chief,

Please find enclosed our manuscript, ``Measuring UK Crime Gangs: A Social Network Problem'' by Oatley and Crick, which we would like to submit for publication as an original article in Social Network Analysis and Mining. This is an invited submission from our work presented at ASONAM 2014 in August 2014.

To our knowledge, this is the first report showing preliminary outcomes from a study to tackle the problem of
gang-related crime in the UK during the 2000s; we believe our findings would appeal to the readership of Social Network Analysis and Mining.

We confirm that this manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. As per your email dated 12 October 2014 (and from the first round of reviewing), I can confirm that this manuscript represents a substantially extended (40%+) and revised version of our short ASONAM 2014 papers (4 pages), with updated background, literature review and methodology, along with new data and analysis. All authors have approved the manuscript and fully support its submission to Social Network Analysis and Mining.

Please address all correspondence to me at tcrick@cardiffmet.ac.uk; we look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience.

With kind regards,

Dr Tom Crick
