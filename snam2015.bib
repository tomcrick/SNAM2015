	of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur
	in the tail of the distributionï¿½the part of the distribution representing

	power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially
	inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and

	still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the

	framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical

	goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorovï¿½Smirnov (KS) statistic
	and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach
	with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous
	approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world
	data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has
	been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases

	networks, one needs to analyze how and why networks form, the impact
	of network structure on agents' outcomes, and the evolution of networks
	over time. For this purpose, we combine a network game introduced
	by Ballester et al. [2006], where the Nash equilibrium action of
	each agent is proportional to her Bonacich centrality, with an endogenous
	network formation process. Links are formed on the basis of agents'
	centrality while the network is exposed to a volatile environment
	introducing interruptions in the connections between agents. A remarkable
	feature of our dynamic network formation process is that, at each
	period of time, the network is a nested split graph. This graph has
	very nice mathematical properties and are relatively easy to characterize.

	the detection and prevention of the volume crime of burglary. A discussion
	of data mining and decision support technologies that have the potential
	to address these issues is undertaken and illustrated with reference
	the authors' work with three Police Services. The focus is upon the
	use of ï¿½softï¿½ forensic evidence which refers to modus operandi and
	the temporal and geographical features of the crime, rather than
	ï¿½hardï¿½ evidence such as DNA or fingerprint evidence. Three objectives
	underpin this paper. First, given the continuing expansion of forensic
	computing and its role in the emergent discipline of Crime Science,
	it is timely to present a review of existing methodologies and research.
	Second, it is important to extract some practical lessons concerning
	the application of computer science within this forensic domain.
	Finally, from the lessons to date, a set of conclusions will be advanced,
	including the need for multidisciplinary input to guide further developments
	in the design of such systems. The objectives are achieved by first
	considering the task performed by the intended systems users. The
	discussion proceeds by identifying the portions of these tasks for
	which automation would be both beneficial and feasible. The knowledge
	discovery from databases process is then described, starting with
	an examination of the data that police collect and the reasons for
	storing it. The discussion progresses to the development of crime
	matching and predictive knowledge which are operationalised in decision
	support software. The paper concludes by arguing that computer science
	technologies which can support criminal investigations are wide ranging
	and include geographical information systems displays, clustering
	and link analysis algorithms and the more complex use of data mining
	technology for profiling crimes or offenders and matching and predicting
	crimes. We also argue that knowledge from disciplines such as forensic
	psychology, criminology and statistics are essential to the efficient

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate whether weak ties play an

	a model where individuals learn about crime opportunities by interacting
	with other peers. These interactions can take the form of either
	strong or weak ties. We find that increasing the percentage of weak
	ties induces more transitions from non-crime to crime and thus the
	crime rate in the economy increases. This is because, when the percentage
	of weak ties is high, delinquents and non-delinquents are in close
	contact with each other. We then test these predictions using the
	U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth),
	which contains unique detailed informations on friendship relationships
	among teenagers. The theoretical predictions of our model are confirmed

  abstract = {Social commerce is an emerging trend in which online shops create
	referral hyperlinks to other shops in the same online marketplace.
	We study the evolution of a social commerce network in a large online
	marketplace. Our dataset starts before the birth of the network (at
	which points shops were not linked to each other) and includes the
	birth of the network. The network under study exhibits a typical
	power-law degree distribution. We empirically compare a set of edge
	formation mechanisms (including preferential attachment and triadic
	closure) that may explain the emergence of this property. Our results
	suggest that the evolution of the network and the emergence of its
	power-law degree distribution are better explained by a network evolution
	mechanism that relies on vertex attributes that are not based on
	the structure of the network. Specifically, our analysis suggests
	that the power-law degree distribution emerges because shops prefer
	to connect to shops with more diverse assortments, and assortment
	diversity follows a power-law distribution. Shops with more diverse
	assortments are more attractive to link to because they are more
	likely to bring traffic from consumers browsing the WWW. Therefore,
	our results also imply that social commerce networks should not be
	studied in isolation, but rather in the context of the broader network
	in which they are embedded (the WWW).},

  abstract = {Everyone knows the small-world phenomenon: soon after meeting a stranger,
	we are surprised to discover that we have a mutual friend, or we
	are connected through a short chain of acquaintances. In his book,
	Duncan Watts uses this intriguing phenomenon--colloquially called
	"six degrees of separation"--as a prelude to a more general exploration:
	under what conditions can a small world arise in any kind of network?
	
	
	The networks of this story are everywhere: the brain is a network
	of neurons; organisations are people networks; the global economy
	is a network of national economies, which are networks of markets,
	which are in turn networks of interacting producers and consumers.
	Food webs, ecosystems, and the Internet can all be represented as
	networks, as can strategies for solving a problem, topics in a conversation,
	and even words in a language. Many of these networks, the author
	claims, will turn out to be small worlds.
	
	
	How do such networks matter? Simply put, local actions can have global
	consequences, and the relationship between local and global dynamics
	depends critically on the network's structure. Watts illustrates
	the subtleties of this relationship using a variety of simple models---the
	spread of infectious disease through a structured population; the
	evolution of cooperation in game theory; the computational capacity
	of cellular automata; and the sychronisation of coupled phase-oscillators.
	
	
	Watts's novel approach is relevant to many problems that deal with
	network connectivity and complex systems' behaviour in general: How
	do diseases (or rumours) spread through social networks? How does
	cooperation evolve in large groups? How do cascading failures propagate
	through large power grids, or financial systems? What is the most
	efficient architecture for an organisation, or for a communications
	network? This fascinating exploration will be fruitful in a remarkable
	variety of fields, including physics and mathematics, as well as
	sociology, economics, and biology.},
